Dots is now a multi-accounts app!

With this update, you no longer need to log out and back in to use different accounts (addresses) with Dots. You can add and remove unlimited accounts.

A new "accounts" page shows an overview of all of your connected accounts, along with the status of any migrations to BNSx for that account.

You can complete multiple BNSx migrations simultaneously, with migration status reflected in real-time on the accounts page.
